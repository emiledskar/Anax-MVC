My name is Emil Edskär and I'm 23 years old. I currently studying Interaction and Design in Umeå. I'm on my fifth and last year and i'm looking forward to finish my education and to start working.

When I'm not studying, I spend a lot of time on various forms of training. I have previously played both football and hockey but nowadays i'm mostly working out in the gym.
